# Using ML and NLP to establish your first competitive listing for your Airbnb property

* The first model creates a pricing tool for a first Airbnb property using features just related to the property, the location, and amenities. The predicted price will be used as a feature in the second model.

* The second model will be set to maximise the user repose on a listing and predict an overall consumer review. The target will be defined in the process.

For feature selection, the Genetic Algorithm is used.

The model interpretability will be discussed using SHAP [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html) and how to leverage NLP for modelling and analysing the neighbourhood description given the overall score review.
