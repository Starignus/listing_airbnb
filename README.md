# Using ML and NLP to establish your first competitive listing for your Airbnb property

* The first model consist in create a pricing tool for a first Airbnb property using features just related to the property, the location, and amenities. The predicted price will be sued as a feature in the second model.

* The second model will be set to maximise the user repose on a listing, and need to predict an over all consumer review. The target will be defined in the process.

For feature selection the Genetic Algorithm was used. 

It will be discussed the model interpretability using [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html) and how to leverage NLP for modelling and for analysing the neighbourhood description given the overall score review.
